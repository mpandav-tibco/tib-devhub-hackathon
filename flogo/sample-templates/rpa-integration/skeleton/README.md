# Flogo and RPA: Automating Complex Workflows

This demo application showcases the integration of TIBCO FlogoÂ® with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools to automate complex workflows and bridge the gap between modern and legacy systems.

## What is RPA?

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that uses software robots (bots) to automate repetitive and rule-based tasks. RPA bots can interact with user interfaces, applications, and systems, mimicking human actions to perform tasks such as data entry, data extraction, and system integration.

## Why Flogo and RPA?

Flogo complements RPA by providing an event-driven orchestration layer. Flogo can be used to:

* Trigger RPA bots based on events or conditions.
* Pass data to and from RPA bots.
* Handle complex logic and decision-making.
* Integrate with various systems and services.

## Use Case: Automating Product Creation

This demo automates the process of creating new products in a web application using Flogo and UiPath.

* Flogo: Receives product data (e.g., from an API call) and triggers a UiPath bot.
* UiPath: Opens a web browser, fills out a product creation form, and submits it.

## How to Use

1. **Set up UiPath:**
    * Install UiPath Studio.
    * Create a UiPath bot that can fill out a web form with provided data. You can refer to Bot app available under directory ` /UiPath `
    * Publish the bot to UiPath Automation Cloud.

2. **Create a Flogo app:**
    * Clone the repo
    * Import the rpa-integration.flogo application into your Flogo Dev Environment.
    * Use  pre-exising .flogotest to verify the behavior
    * Update your configuration of webhook api and schema for your automation process


3. **Run the demo:**
    * Trigger the Flogo app with sample product data.
    * Observe the UiPath bot automating the product creation process.
